## Leo
Built on top of the excellent [BotUI](https://github.com/botui/botui), this is a conversational interface set up to use a provided JSON file to build up a conversation between a user and the bot.

Named Leo for the craic, and also to kind of line up with a Learning Enhancement Officer/Operation acronym to fit it's intended purpose.

Simple enough in it's current form, we can fork this and change up the script it uses for different purposes. Primary purpose right now will be for AdelaideX and Adelaide University interactives.

## Roadmap
**Next up:** Make the app configurable within itself instead of having to open up the JSON in a code editor.
